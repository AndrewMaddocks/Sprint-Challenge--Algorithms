#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a.the runtime complexity is O(n) which means it is linear time and as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a SAME slower rate.the solutuion is generally acceptable.

b. the runtime complexity is O(log n) which means it is Logaritmic Time and as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a SLIGHTLY SLOWER rate.the solutuion is pretty good.

c. the runtime complexity is O(n) which means it is linear time and as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used will grow at a SAME slower rate.the solutuion is generally acceptable.

## Exercise II

I think the best possible way to go about this is using binary search which will make it so if you go to whatever floor that is the middle floor and drop the egg you are able to eliminate all the floors that are higher then you go to the next midpoint until you are able to find exactly which floor is floor f. this is O(log n).
